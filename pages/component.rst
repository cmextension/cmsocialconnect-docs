There are 3 options:

* **Load Font Awesome**: CM Social Connect requires Font Awesome. If Font Awesome is already loaded by another extension (for example, your template), you set this option to "No", otherwise you should set to "Yes".
* **Load CSS**: Load CSS of CM Social Connect which contains some styles for login and register buttons to make them more beautiful. If you don't load CSS, your template CSS will be used.
* **Show in Users component's profile**: Show connection info in Users component's profile view and connect/disconnect options in Users component's profile form.
